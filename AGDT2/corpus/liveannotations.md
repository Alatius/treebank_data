## Live Annotations

The following table contains links to the morphosyntactic and/or semantic annotations performed on the collaborative Platform Perseids through the Annotation tool Arethusa. The annotations can there be viewed and downloaded (click on the drop-down arrow at the top-right corner of the screen). These annotations are usually work-in-progress, so they can vary across time. If you plan to perform research on these data, save a copy of it. Annotations that have been reviewed and are stable will be published in the stableannotation folder.
