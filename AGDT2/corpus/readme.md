## README

This folder contains two resources:

1. a subfolder with stable reviewed annotations that have been treebanked according to the Ancient Greek Dependency Treebank 2 guidelines.

2. a md file with links to "live annotations": it is possible to display and download annotation created within the (free) collaborative Platform [Perseids](sosol.perseids.org/sosol/) and the (free) Annotation tool Arethusa. If you plan to use these texts for research, please save a copy of them, in that they might change over time.
