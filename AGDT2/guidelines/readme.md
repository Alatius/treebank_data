## README

This folder contains the guidelines used to treebank the texts of the Ancient Greek and Dependency Treebank 2

Two formats for the guidelines are available: 

```
1. html 
2. md 
```
The html version is the standard one that should be used for treebanking: it has to be downloaded and consulted in a browser. The md version is made available only for quick reference on Github, not requiring download.

Please quote the guidelines in the following way:
